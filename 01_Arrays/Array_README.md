# There are 3 files
1. array.cpp --> this file has the implementaion of the class array methods.
2. array.hpp --> this file has the header of the class array methods including attributes and functions prototypes.
3. main.cpp  --> it just have some lines of code that used when testing the methods { edit it as you wish (: }.
4. output    --> this is the executable file after run the command: `g++ array.cpp main.cpp -o output`.
